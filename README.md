* The System.IO.Compression.FileSystem type assembly must be available on the machine.

#### Parameters

* **[String] Path** _(Key)_: The path to the archive file that should be expanded to or removed from the specified destination.
* **[String] Destination** _(Key)_: The path where the specified archive file should be expanded to or removed from.
* **[String] Ensure** _(Write)_: Specifies whether or not the expanded content of the archive file at the specified path should exist at the specified destination. To update the specified destination to have the expanded content of the archive file at the specified path, specify this property as Present. To remove the expanded content of the archive file at the specified path from the specified destination, specify this property as Absent. The default value is Present. { *Present* | Absent }.
* **[Boolean] Validate** _(Write)_: Specifies whether or not to validate that a file at the destination with the same name as a file in the archive actually matches that corresponding file in the archive by the specified checksum method. If the file does not match and Ensure is specified as Present and Force is not specified, the resource will throw an error that the file at the desintation cannot be overwritten. If the file does not match and Ensure is specified as Present and Force is specified, the file at the desintation will be overwritten.

An invalid argument exception will be thrown if Checksum is specified while Validate is specified as false. ModifiedDate will check that the LastWriteTime property of the file at the destination matches the LastWriteTime property of the file in the archive. CreatedDate will check that the CreationTime property of the file at the destination matches the CreationTime property of the file in the archive. SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512 will check that the hash of the file at the destination by the specified SHA method matches the hash of the file in the archive by the specified SHA method. The default value is ModifiedDate. { *ModifiedDate* | CreatedDate | SHA-1 | SHA-256 | SHA-512 }
* **[System.Management.Automation.PSCredential] Credential** _(Write)_: The credential of a user account with permissions to access the specified archive path and destination if needed.
* **[Boolean] Force** _(Write)_: Specifies whether or not any existing files or directories at the destination with the same name as a file or directory in the archive should be overwritten to match the file or directory in the archive. When this property is false, an error will be thrown if an item at the destination needs to be overwritten. The default value is false.

    * Updated resource to follow HQRM guidelines.
    * Added examples.
    * Added unit and end-to-end tests.
    * Significantly cleaned the resource.
    * Minor Breaking Change where the resource will now throw an error if no value is provided, Ensure is set to present, and the variable does not exist, whereas before it would create an empty registry key on the machine in this case (if this is the desired outcome then use the Registry resource).
    * Added a new Write property 'Target', which specifies whether the user wants to set the machine variable, the process variable, or both (previously it was setting both in most cases).
* xGroup:
    * Group members in the "NT Authority", "BuiltIn" and "NT Service" scopes should now be resolved without an error. If you were seeing the errors "Exception calling ".ctor" with "4" argument(s): "Server names cannot contain a space character."" or "Exception calling ".ctor" with "2" argument(s): "Server names cannot contain a space character."", this fix should resolve those errors. If you are still seeing one of the errors, there is probably another local scope we need to add. Please let us know.
    * The resource will no longer attempt to resolve group members if Members, MembersToInclude, and MembersToExclude are not specified.
