# xPSDesiredStateConfiguration

The **xPSDesiredStateConfiguration** module is a more recent, experimental
version of the PSDesiredStateConfiguration module that ships in Windows as part
of PowerShell 4.0.

The high quality, supported version of this module is available as
[PSDscResources](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSDscResources).

This module is automatically tested using PowerShell 5.1 on servers running
Windows 2012 R2 and Windows 2016, and is expected to work on other operating
systems running PowerShell 5.1. While this module may work with PowerShell
versions going back to PowerShell 4, there is no automatic testing performed
for these versions, and thus no guarantee that the module will work as
expected.

This project has adopted [this code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### xArchive

Provides a mechanism to expand an archive (.zip) file to a specific path or
remove an expanded archive (.zip) file from a specific path on a target node.

#### Requirements

* The System.IO.Compression type assembly must be available on the machine.
* The System.IO.Compression.FileSystem type assembly must be available on the
  machine.

#### Parameters

* **[String] Path** _(Key)_: The path to the archive file that should be
  expanded to or removed from the specified destination.
* **[String] Destination** _(Key)_: The path where the specified archive file
  should be expanded to or removed from.
* **[String] Ensure** _(Write)_: Specifies whether or not the expanded content
  of the archive file at the specified path should exist at the specified
  destination. To update the specified destination to have the expanded content
  of the archive file at the specified path, specify this property as Present.
  To remove the expanded content of the archive file at the specified path from
  the specified destination, specify this property as Absent. The default value
  is Present. { *Present* | Absent }.
* **[Boolean] Validate** _(Write)_: Specifies whether or not to validate that a
  file at the destination with the same name as a file in the archive actually
  matches that corresponding file in the archive by the specified checksum
  method. If the file does not match and Ensure is specified as Present and
  Force is not specified, the resource will throw an error that the file at the
  desintation cannot be overwritten. If the file does not match and Ensure is
  specified as Present and Force is specified, the file at the desintation will
  be overwritten. If the file does not match and Ensure is specified as Absent,
  the file at the desintation will not be removed. The default Checksum method
  is ModifiedDate. The default value is false.
* **[String] Checksum** _(Write)_: The Checksum method to use to validate
  whether or not a file at the destination with the same name as a file in the
  archive actually matches that corresponding file in the archive. An invalid
  argument exception will be thrown if Checksum is specified while Validate is
  specified as false. ModifiedDate will check that the LastWriteTime property
  of the file at the destination matches the LastWriteTime property of the file
  in the archive. CreatedDate will check that the CreationTime property of the
  file at the destination matches the CreationTime property of the file in the
  archive. SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512 will check that the hash of the file at
  the destination by the specified SHA method matches the hash of the file in
  the archive by the specified SHA method. The default value is ModifiedDate.
  { *ModifiedDate* | CreatedDate | SHA-1 | SHA-256 | SHA-512 }
* **[System.Management.Automation.PSCredential] Credential** _(Write)_: The
  credential of a user account with permissions to access the specified archive
  path and destination if needed.
* **[Boolean] Force** _(Write)_: Specifies whether or not any existing files or
  directories at the destination with the same name as a file or directory in
  the archive should be overwritten to match the file or directory in the
  archive. When this property is false, an error will be thrown if an item at
  the destination needs to be overwritten. The default value is false.

### xDscWebService

* **EndpointName**: The desired web service name.
* **CertificateThumbPrint**: Certificate thumbprint for creating an HTTPS
  endpoint. Use "AllowUnencryptedTraffic" for setting up a non SSL based
  endpoint.
* **Port**: Port for web service.
* **PhysicalPath**: Folder location where the content of the web service
  resides.
* **Ensure**: Ensures that the web service is **Present** or **Absent**
* **State**: State of the web service: { Started | Stopped }
* **ModulePath**: Folder location where DSC resources are stored.
* **ConfigurationPath**: Folder location where DSC configurations are stored.
* **RegistrationKeyPath**: Folder location where DSC pull server registration
  key file is stored.
* **AcceptSelfSignedCertificates**: Whether self signed certificate can be used
  to setup pull server.
* **UseSecurityBestPractices**: Whether to use best practice security settings
  for the node where pull server resides on.
  Caution: Setting this property to $true will reset registry values under
  "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL". This
  environment change enforces the use of stronger encryption cypher and may
  affect legacy applications. More information can be found at
  https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/245030 and
  https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn786418(v=ws.11).aspx.
* **DisableSecurityBestPractices**: The items that are excepted from following
  best practice security settings.
* **Enable32BitAppOnWin64**: When this property is set to true, Pull Server
  will run on a 32 bit process on a 64 bit machine.
* **ConfigureFirewall**: When this property is set to true, a Windows Firewall    rule will be created, which allows incoming HTTP traffic for the selected **Port**. Default: **true**

**Remark:**

Configuring a Windows Firewall rule (exception) for a DSC Pull Server instance by using the xDscWebService resource is **considered deprecated** and thus will be removed in the future. 

DSC will issue a warning when the **ConfigureFirewall** property is set to **true**. Currently the default value is **true** to maintain backwards compatibility with existing configurations. At a later time the default value will be set to **false** and in the last step the direct support to create a firewall rule will be removed.

All users are requested to adjust existing configurations so that the **ConfigureFirewall** is set to **false** and a required Windows Firewall rule is created by using the **Firewall** resource from the [NetworkingDsc](https://github.com/PowerShell/NetworkingDsc) module.
