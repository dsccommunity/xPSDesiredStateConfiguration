The **xPSDesiredStateConfiguration** module is a more recent, experimental version of the PSDesiredStateConfiguration module that ships in Windows as part of PowerShell 4.0.

**This module is currently in the process of becoming one of our first experimental High Quality Resource Modules (HQRMs). The plan for updating this module is available [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/xPSDesiredStateConfiguration/blob/dev/HighQualityResourceModulePlan.md). Any comments or questions about this process/plan can be submitted under issue [#160](https://github.com/PowerShell/xPSDesiredStateConfiguration/issues/160).**

### xArchive

* **Destination**: (Key) Specifies the location where you want to ensure the archive contents are extracted.
* **Path**: (Key) Specifies the source path of the archive file.
* **Ensure**: Determines whether to check if the content of the archive exists at the Destination. Set this property to Present to ensure the contents exist. Set it to Absent to ensure they do not exist.
   - Supported values: Present, Absent
   - Default Value: Present
* **Validate**: Uses the Checksum property to determine if the archive matches the signature. If Validate is false, only the file or directory name is used for comparison. If you specify Checksum without Validate, the configuration will fail. If you specify Validate without Checksum, a SHA-256 checksum is used by default.
   - Supported values: true, false
   - Default Value: false
* **Checksum**: Defines the type to use when determining whether two files are the same. If you specify Checksum without Validate, the configuration will fail.
   - Suported values: CreatedDate, ModifiedDate, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512
   - Default value: SHA-256
* **Force**: Setting Force to true with override certain file operations (such as overwriting a file or deleting a directory that is not empty) that would normally result in an error.
   - Supported values: true, false

### xDscWebService

* **AcceptSelfSignedCertificates**: Whether self signed certificate can be used to setup pull server.
* **UseSecurityBestPractices**: Whether to use best practice security settings for the node where pull server resides on.
Caution: Setting this property to $true will reset registry values under "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL". This environment change enforces the use of stronger encryption cypher and may affect legacy applications. More information can be found at https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/245030 and https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn786418(v=ws.11).aspx.
